                <gco:CharacterString>The Wildland Fire Interagency Geospatial Services (WFIGS) Group provides authoritative geospatial data products under the interagency Wildland Fire Data Program. Hosted in the National Interagency Fire Center ArcGIS Online Organization (The NIFC Org), WFIGS provides both internal and public facing data, accessible in a variety of formats.This service includes perimeters for wildland fire incidents that meet the following criteria:
	
		Categorized in the IRWIN (Integrated Reporting of Wildland Fire Information) integration service as a valid Wildfire (WF) or Prescribed Fire (RX) record with a Fire Discovery Date in the year 2022
		Is not &amp;quot;quarantined&amp;quot; in IRWIN due to potential conflicts with other records
		
		Attribution of the source polygon is set to a Feature Access of Public, a Feature Status of Approved, and an Is Visible setting of Yes
		
	

Perimeters are not available for every incident. For a complete set of features that meet the same IRWIN criteria, see the 2022 Wildland Fire Locations to Date service.

	

No &amp;quot;fall-off&amp;quot; rules are applied to this service. 

	


	Criteria were determined by an NWCG Geospatial Subcommittee task group. 
	
		
	
	Data are refreshed every 5 minutes. Changes in the perimeter source may take up to 15 minutes to display.
	
		Perimeters are pulled from multiple sources with rules in place to ensure the most current or most authoritative shape is used.
	
	
		
	
	Attributes and their definitions can be found below. More detail about the NWCG Wildland Fire Event Polygon standard can be found here.
